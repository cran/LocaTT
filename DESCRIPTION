Description: A bioinformatics pipeline for performing taxonomic
    assignment of DNA metabarcoding sequence data while considering
    geographic location. A detailed tutorial is available at
    <https://urodelan.github.io/Local_Taxa_Tool_Tutorial/>.
    A manuscript describing these methods is in preparation.
