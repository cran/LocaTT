#' Truncate DNA Sequences to Specified Length
#'
#' @description Truncates DNA sequences to a specified length.
#' @param sequences A character vector of DNA sequences to truncate.
#' @param length Numeric. The length to truncate DNA sequences to.
#' @param quality_scores An optional character vector of DNA sequence quality scores. If supplied, these will be truncated to their corresponding truncated DNA sequences.
#' @returns If quality scores are not provided, then a character vector of truncated DNA sequences is returned. If quality scores are provided, then a list containing two elements is returned. The first element is a character vector of truncated DNA sequences, and the second element is a character vector of quality scores which have been truncated to their corresponding truncated DNA sequences.
